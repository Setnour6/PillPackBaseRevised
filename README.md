# Revised Pill Pack Base
Fork of Parakeet's Pill Pack with changes from Geozek's Enhanced Pill Pack and new changes to improve the pill pack experience.

This was made because of the lack of potential and customizability of the pill pack bases on the workshop, hence why a revision was made. Best of all, this is open-source so anyone can look at the codes and help work on this addon.
