# Revised Pill Pack Base
Fork of Parakeet's Pill Pack with changes from Geozek's Enhanced Pill Pack and new changes to improve the pill pack experience.

We grew tired of the limits, slow development, and unimplemented potential of the pill pack bases on the workshop, hence why a revision is made. Best of all, this is open-source so anyone can look at the codes.
