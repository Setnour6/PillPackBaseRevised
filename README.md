# Revised Pill Pack Base
Fork of Parakeet's Pill Pack with changes from Geozek & Snazzy's Enhanced Pill Pack and new changes from Dylansonfire and myself to improve the pill pack base experience.

This was made because of the opinionated lack of some potential and customizability of the pill pack bases on the workshop, hence why a revision was made. Best of all, the source is available so anyone can look at the codes and help work on this addon.

Do NOT use this pack with Parakeet's pill pack base, nor with Geozek & Snazzy's enhanced pill base, as that will cause conflicts and lua errors.
In other words, please uninstall other pill pack bases before installing this one.

# Features

In comparision from the enhanced pill pack base:
- More mechanics and changes to existing ones, most from the Pill Pack Hide and Seek gamemode.
- Network bool applied to player when being a pill.
- A lot of configuration options for customizability for almost any play style.
- Better organization of the pills from the base pack and pills from subscribed pill packs on the steam workshop.
- A search bar to look for pills from any pack. A custom from-scratch search bar was made due to difficulties with adding the gmod-made search bar.
