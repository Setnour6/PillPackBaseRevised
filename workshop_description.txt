[h2]Before subscribing, unsubscribe from all other pill pack bases (parakeet's, geozek and snazzy's enhanced, etc.)[/h2]
This was made because of the opinionated lack of some potential and customizability of the pill pack bases on the workshop, hence why a revision was made.

It's open-source on GitHub if anyone wants to help contribute to this addon: https://github.com/Setnour6/PillPackBaseRevised

[h3]Features[/h3]
In comparision from the enhanced pill pack base:
[list]
[*] More mechanics and changes to existing ones, most from the Pill Pack Hide and Seek gamemode.
[*] Network bool applied to player when being a pill.
[*] A lot of configuration options for customizability for almost any play style.
[*] Better organization of the pills from the base pack and pills from subscribed pill packs on the steam workshop.
[*] A search bar to look for pills from any pack. A custom from-scratch search bar was made due to difficulties with adding the gmod-made search bar.
